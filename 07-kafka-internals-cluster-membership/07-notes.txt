1- launch 2 dockers service:
    - zookeeper
    - kafka
2- launch 3 brokers
3- the idea of this hands-on is
    - to view the ephemeral node being created on zookeeper whenever a broker is launched
    - view the first broker being labelized as controller
    - view the logging on zookeeper whenever a broker is spawned/stopped

this will be made using confluent-kafka-python
